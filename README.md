# Geofence-System-with-Trustworthiness-Analysis

Overview

This project implements a real-time object detection and geofence monitoring system using the YOLO model. It also evaluates and analyzes the system's trustworthiness by simulating various attacks, assessing potential security and privacy risks, and benchmarking the system for fairness and bias issues.
